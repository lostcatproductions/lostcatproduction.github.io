### Support Us

Right now, this project being done because we love the Amiga community and believe that we could use a really awesome 68000 accelerator. Absolutely everything from the hardware, to the firmware and eventually to the software will be open source. While we will eventually do a retail launch, we could use your support in the meantime. We're making it very easy to help fund us through PayPal or Buy me a Coffee. We hope to enable GitHub sponsorship soon as well.
